# Shortest-Path-to-Get-Around-MIT
Repo of codes that implements Graph Algorithm to find the shortest path from start to the destination point 
This code is developed based using the course material offered by MIT for the "Introduction to Computational Thinking and Data Science"

# User Instruction:
The Driver Code file is "PathFinder.py". when the user runs the code, first list of all building connection will be displayed (e.g. 36 ['32', '26', '34', '46', '48'] means starting point 36 is connected to list of buildings 32, 26, 34, 46,48. This means that there is an Edge object for 36 and each of these destinations, e.g. Edge(36,34)).
User should enter the starting point, final destination, max allowable distance and max allowable outdoor distance. 
Using the Diagraph algorithm, code suggests the shortest path to get from start point to destination
